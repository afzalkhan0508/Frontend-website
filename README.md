🌐 Frontend Website Project

This is a responsive and interactive frontend website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my frontend development skills through real-world features like:

🖼️ Image Slider for dynamic visual content

📩 Enquiry Form with input validation

🔘 Call-to-Action Buttons for user interaction

💻 Clean and structured code with a modern UI design

📱 Fully responsive layout for all screen sizes


📁 This project also includes some of my previous HTML/CSS/JS mini-projects, integrated into one cohesive frontend experience.
